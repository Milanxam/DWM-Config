## Patches and features

my lightly modified version of Lukesmith's DWM Config

### Features:

1. Clickable statusbar with my build of dwmblocks.
2. Reads xresources colors/variables (i.e. works with pywal, etc.).
3. scratchpad: Accessible with mod+shift+enter.
4. ew layouts: bstack, fibonacci, deck, centered master and more. All bound to keys super+(shift+)t/y/u/i.
5. True fullscreen (super+f) and prevents focus shifting.
6. Windows can be made sticky (super+s).
7. stacker: Move windows up the stack manually (super-K/J).
8. shiftview: Cycle through tags (super+g/;).
9. vanitygaps: Gaps allowed across all layouts.
10. swallow patch: if a program run from a terminal would make it inoperable, it temporarily takes its place to save space.
